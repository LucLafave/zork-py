1) I attempted all parts of the extra credit and I believe I have completed them all. However, I may not
have done so correctly.
2) The biggest challenge that I have faced is the item part. It was hard to move the information back and forth.
I had to do this in very intresting ways and by using slicing and other things. I believe I accomplshed it however,
I do not think that I did the correct way as specified however I believe it works.
3) The custom creative things I added are as follows:
-can collect a fish(does nothing)
-going north of lake area will lead to armory where a sword can be collected
-this sword can kill the ogre in the forest area and this is a short cut to the treasure room.
